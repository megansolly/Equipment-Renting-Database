This is our SQLite Java Database implementation, using PreparedStatements to effectively take queries from users.

In order to run the java database in VSCode, what you need to do is the
following:
1. Extract the .zip file somewhere such that you see the folder
containing everything and "JavaDatabase" inside of it.
2. Open VSCode and select File>Open Folder and navigate to that folder.
3. You need to navigate to the directory that contains four folders:
.vscode, bin, lib, and src. Click "Select Folder".
4. Once you do this, the project will open in your editor. Ensure you
have the proper JDK installed first and other add-ons necessary.
5. Now, you can run the program with DB.java, clicking the Run arrow in
the top right of your screen.
Now, the database is running!
